It's fantastic. Even for people unfamiliar with FromSoft's other games, this game is accessible in spite of its lineage of difficulty. There are multiple things you can do to gain strength, and also multiple strategies you can employ within combat itself.The addition of the open world and crafting system is a huge boon to the formula. The open world encourages exploration, which has always been a strong point in FromSoft games, and also opens up tons of opportunities to power up through side activities and explore quests through the various characters you can find and talk to. The crafting system also functions as a way to ease exploration by creating useful tools, as well as make combat more manageable through crafting throwables, ammo, status inflicting items and buffs.The moment to moment gameplay is vastly improved as well. You still have your light and heavy attacks, your guarding and parrying, and your magical spells in two different flavors. But all of these features have improved in a number of ways, including new ways to interact in combat. Combat Arts can be a fundamental part of the way you play, opening up lots of new moves and abilities, the new guard counter allows for a much more defensive playstyle to punish opponents after they attack, and heavy (especially charged heavy) attacks can break your opponents stance to open them up to critical hits. If you're struggling with a fight, changing your strategy can be a viable option, and if that fails then opening up the crafting menu can also give you the edge you need. If all else fails, you can rely on your fellow Tarnished and summon a friend (or stranger) to help you out in multiplayer.This game is the best version released of FromSoft's formula that they've been refining for years. As someone who's played every game in the Souls series, including Bloodborne and Sekiro, this one is my favorite. And here's to hoping the DLC improves on this already great game even more!;Recommended;1632;112.7;03-29-2024

I like that you have to pay attention to attacks of enemies and running headlong into a fight is not always the best way to defeat enemies. Also, the variation of styles of your character allows for replay ability with varying outcomes of quests. One real negative thing I have to say is dialogue and story is sometimes tedious.;Recommended;270;342.2;03-29-2024
"This game saved my career as a truck driver. On the night of February 20, 2022 I was called into my boss's office. Larry sat me down on the other side of his desk, at this moment I was quite ecstatic, I thought I was going to get a pay raise for how good I had been doing on the road! Oh boy was I wrong. Larry had told me that I was actually causing a loss of profits for the company and that if I didn't step up my performance soon they would have no choice but to get rid of me. I thought to myself ""♥♥♥♥! I can't lose my job, I'm 57 years old with 10 years of payments left on my mortgage, $15,000 in student loan debt, $50,000 in credit card debt, a wife, 3 kids, 4 dogs, and 2 cats. This might be the end for me."" I took the next day off of work to collect myself, and that's when I saw it. I opened up Steam for the first time in months, at the top there was a bright green banner with the beautiful, bold, yellowed letters ""ELDEN RING"" at the top. Now, as a big fan of the previous hit FromSoftware game ""Dark Souls 2"" I knew I had to check it out. I was hooked just from the images, don't even get me started about those videos. They put a little pep in my step if you're picking up what I'm putting down. I pre-ordered the game immediately, but I thought to myself ""How do I play this on the road?"" I knew there was only one option, so I did it. I ordered a Steam Deck to accompany me on my journeys travelling through the blessed lands of freedom. Before I knew it, the Steam Deck had arrived and Elden Ring had been released. I played this game every single night when I was parked in the truck stops. I was in love, for the first time in forever I felt like I enjoyed my job again. I was motivated to get my performance up and save my career. My performance increased by 76% when I started playing Elden Ring and my boss actually ended up giving me a raise.

The Game is mediocre at best. While the story and the content are marvelous, the design, music and scenery is some to really behold. IT all falls apart in the gameplay mechanic.Early game you have to really grind to get somewhere and progress and rewarding is measured with a strict hand. You better stick 1 specific weapon and sink all the upgrades in it or the bosses will become even more grinding than they are at some point.Midgame the pace picks up and until you get to the endgame content, you can fare pretty good and the rewards upscale a lot. This is the part where most fun is to be had.Endgame content is typical, every enemy is overscaled, overpoised, overboosted in every way. In some cases some simple regular enemies have more hitpoints than some midgame bosses. Technically your HP is irrelevant as you are 1-3 hits, depending on your vitality. In some cases, some simpel field mobs are pvp worthy, the invader NPC-s have nothing compared to them. Even bosses can be hardly compared to some. Also, mediocre weapons are hidden in endgame which would be useful in earlier stages, grabbing them simply adds nothing to the gameplay.In many cases the best tactic to use: dash from 1 SG to another, you have your progress saved. Farming is done via boss assisting, item acquisition can be postponed. You won't use most of them anyway in bossfights.Also when a game has pixelperfect platforming integrated instantly looses 3 points in my eyes.All in all not a bad game but the endgame technically kills the part to which try to aim.Tho Malenia is cool.;Not Recommended;1290;287.5;03-29-2024

This game is a masterpiece, I don't like to glaze too much, but this game just deserves it. this game is huge and you will have lots to do, the enemies are challenging so you won't speed through the game too quickly, the story is very in depth and interesting, the game has lots of customisation so you can enjoy a build that works for you. The open world format for this game helps because if you are struggling with a boss, you can go somewhere else and get stronger, now the boss will be less difficult. only thing i don't like is the multiplayer, it kind of sucks, but there are mods that fix that. 10/10;Recommended;492;96.7;03-29-2024

Put 130 hours in and didn't even beat it.This game offers so much in terms of world, items, bosses, side-content, interconnected story-lines, etc, that even players seasoned to this type of game can still get bogged down.That being said, I had to come back to prepare for the DLC in June.ELDEN RING's take on an open-world was very well-executed, dense with points of interest, and varied in terms of environment and enemy type. Even though not perfect when compared to other FROMSOFT games, mainly in its tendency to reuse bosses somewhat heavy-handedly, the sense of exploration and achievement you can get from this title is amazing9/10[Waiting to see how DLC affects game at large];Recommended;572;144.4;03-29-2024

"Elden Ring was my first souls game and I have to say I was not disappointed at all. The style of gameplay was new to me because I've known nothing besides first person shooter games; nonetheless I was able to adjust fast. If you're looking for something new, fun, rewarding, and intense I suggest this game highly. Not only is the game amazing in terms of graphics, but it prevails in other areas where developers seem to be struggling right now as of 2024. For instance: Story/lore, gameplay mechanics, level design, voice acting, in-game rewards, no micro transactions, helpful/funny/dedicated community, graphics again, creativity, etc. I can go on and on about how great Elden Ring is but this is actually that one game where you must play it for yourself to find out. If you get stuck there's plenty of guides and videos online to help you. This is one investment you will not regret. Have fun Tarnished!";Recommended;752;168.4;03-29-2024

I get it, another Elden Ring review that is negative that is unfounded but just giving my feedback.The mandatory, I have played Demon Souls, all of the Dark Souls games, Sekiro Armored Core 6 (I know its not Souls but its awesome!).I like the tighter experience of previous titles, smaller, interconnected, filled with purpose.I felt Elden Ring was just a big world with dumb mobs placed every where, dungeons that felt so samey, reskinned bosses, and just crap tons of stuff to get into. For me it was a grind to just get through it.I guess I have gotten older and want to play whats fun not whats trendy, it just wasnt for me. I am not a combat efficientato by any means and the options, spells, ashes of war, summons were all good systems. At its core though, for ME, its just tiresome. Why or how can poison go through a wall? Why can a bad guy plunge his axe through rock and hit you on the other side? Why do bosses have unlimited stamina? Elden Ring had some of the most aggressive boss battles I have ever played through in a From Software game. Hands down. The last section of the game is littered with them back to back to back, its insane. Granted the open world gives opportunities to gain some flasks back but thats so you dont have to go back to a spot to heal again, it didnt make it more accepting in terms of difficulty. The dungeons generally are filled with the same wolves, pots, and gremlins, with a few traps and a boss or two at the end of it. Once you get the goodies in the dungeon or cave you usually find yourself dead at the bosses door or near death with no flasks forcing you to death with the boss so that you can just run all the way to the door again if there was no stake to bring you back to near the door. Fighting on the horse was fun although, the farther you get into the game, the more you realize the horse is just another piece of armor that most enemies are going to be able to kill. Its fast but they are faster.I think for people who love this genre and the Souls franchise this is a dream come true. Its a big expansive world with enough variety for people who want to see it, and lots of things to explore. More mini bosses, more dungeons, more exploration, more armor/weapons, summons, just more more more. But its also just more frustration, cheap boss battles and the forever present git gud nastiness of the community when it comes to giving feedback.;Not Recommended;1949;84.1;03-29-2024

Probably the most fun I ever had in a video game. Exploration feels really fun and rewarding. Not just for the loot but the sight you get is a reward in itself. Combat is typical souls combat but with new skills and spells. The danger you feel while exploring the world really makes you feel like you are on a adventure which a game very rarely manages to get right in my opinion.The things I dislike are rather minor like the copy pasted catacombs with copy/pasted enemies and interior. You may also get to other low level zones later which means you'll completely obliterate a boss, that could be fun to learn. The biggest problem I have with this game is the reuse of enemies and bosses. There are MANY unique enemies and bosses but some bosses appear like 6 times which takes some of the excitement away. Especially when a big story boss reappears as a random optional boss with a misspelled name.;Recommended;738;272.9;03-29-2024

Wow amazing game a little late to the party becasue I just got a pc this holiday but this game is great, im only like 22 hours in and like 2 main bosses down and im still loving every second of this game! Im sure you all heard it by now but this game is a must buy 10/10 for me.;Recommended;218;24.8;03-28-2024
This game is incredible. Have played it from start to finish at least a dozen times now, including (1) play-through that is at NG+6. It's difficult, and certainly has a learning curve, being my first souls-type game, but it was probably the most rewarding game to complete I've ever played. Gladly will be paying for the DLC to extend this gameplay.One warning, is that once you learn the combat system of this game, it will make all others feel stale, boring, or easy in comparison. That is the only down-side I had found, and I'm not entirely sure it's a bad thing to have high standards for gaming studios moving forward.;Recommended;514;290.9;03-28-2024

Obviously nothing really needs to be said about this game what with it being so critically acclaimed and all. I loved it! The stealth mechanic that migrated over from Sekiro is a welcome addition. So many of the environments felt like call backs to previous soulsbourne games which I loved to see. There are so many different play styles available for someone since their are so many different weapons and spells. 10/10- would forget my entire playthrough and enjoy again!;Recommended;393;124.2;03-28-2024

The accumulation of all From Software's best ideas and fantastic combat put into a huge open world with over 80 bosses. There's so many random encounters and dungeons to explore and endless weapons to try it feels like an adventure that never ends, every new location discovered better than the last. Not to mention the jaw dropping visuals with a level of detail that is a true feat for a game of this size.Yeah it's pretty good;Recommended;353;60.7;03-28-2024

Very rarely do I wish that a game never ended, but this one felt like a magnificent dream that looked to have no end in sight. When it finally did it was a bitter sweet moment. Every area is so detailed, so beautiful, so rich in character and atmosphere that its almost unreal. The combat is fluid, weapons/spells are all interesting and feel fresh whenever you use something new, build diversity is there. The enemies offer challenge level from easy to hard to b.s but that's all part of this mountain that you must climb, b.s and all. Some of the best designed bosses in all souls games including sekiro. Jumping is a simple yet refreshing game mechanic that makes the game play feel more free. The MUSIC needs to praise because it goes without saying. 10/10;Recommended;624;144.9;03-28-2024

The graphics and quality are stunning, the fluidity is amazing and you will never get such an amazing open world for a Souls-like again. The fact that you have to puzzle the whole story together also makes it feel never ending. I feel like this is a generation's accumulation of gaming and Data all put together to create one huge masterpiece.

Very good game, just incredibly overrated😂 everyone praises this game like it’s the best game ever made EVER but in reality it’s a super fun and challenging game about killing kickass monsters. It’s just like darksouls where it doesn’t tell a story, but has a lot of history told through set pieces, so this game is great to watch a video and just grind out bosses in an open world.;Recommended;313;3.2;03-28-2024

Elden Ring made me stop playing halfway because towards the late game it was getting a little too brutal, BUT WE DONT BACK DOWN AND WE NEVER GIVE UP AND WE BEAT IT 2 MORE TIMES BECAUSE THIS IS GOTY. I always say the souls games get better the more you replay them. So if you read this, get a new character and your dragon smithing stones ready the the shadow of the erdtree.I be Mohging all the way to the erdtree, first play through was a grim reaper black flame scythe build (made for a strength play-style but with a focus on dexterity). The frenzied flame incantations are the best edition to the souls magic system and was the core of my NG+ play through. Lazers shooting out your eyes and morgotts cursed sword were stat hungry tools but lvl 155 allowed for a hybrid build that leaves scorched earth in a wake. The 3rd play through I finally got around to using my favorite archetype of weapon, the colossal swords. Worked in most of them to deal with different areas and bosses but the real hero was actually working the grafted dragon first to the off hand to roll catch and get safe hits on bosses. The mimic tear spirit ashes is for noobs. So I used the Jellyfish and the stormhawk. Intelligence and the way of fists are gonna be the next play through.;Recommended;1026;256.0;03-28-2024

I'm writing this review out of gratitude to FromSoftware and a person called D.Dark Souls type games where never my thing, I never hated them. I just felt them to be too difficult and didn't seethe reward in them.Elden ring was exposure therapy for me, suggested to me by D.I had severe trauma related to failing from my childhood, so I had my doubts about how this would help.However with help from D, the repeated failings/deaths turned into courage to take on bigger bosses.Now after months of hard work I have all the achievements in a game I never thought I would ever playand i'm starting to take on bigger challenges in my life. I'm no longer crippled by my past as long as I am challenging myself.So thank you to D and to FromSoftwareI'm greatfull;Recommended;620;140.0;03-28-2024

Fantastic entry by Fromsoft, I've never been let down so far and Elden Ring is truly a modern classic. I liked it so much I even bought a copy for my PC for the DLC in July. It can be extremely difficult but they have many ways to make a boss fight or situation easier. You are missing out on one of the greatest games of all time, just buy it and try it for an hour or so then get a refund if you dont like it (but you will).;Recommended;336;228.2;03-28-2024

Uma obra primaO jogo não levou o goty atoa, um mundo aberto extremamente vivo, com muitos objetivos para fazer itens para encontra, uma variedade enorme de armas e build para variar a gameplay, o combate do jogo é maravilhoso, e não tenho nem oque comentar sobre como a Lore desse jogo é incrível e como todas as bossfight são boas e únicas, com efeitos sonoros e uma trilha sonora de bater Palmas de pé, a batalha contra rykard e radaan são um ótimo exemplo disso, um jogo que dificilmente cairá no esquecimento. E de todos os jogos que já joguei com certeza esse é o com o melhor fator replay de todos, você quer muito jogar de novo e de novo. Recomendo para qualquer pessoa, e para quem nunca jogou souls like assim como eu, começe com esse jogo, você vai se encantar sem duvidas, uma obra prima e um dos melhores jogos que já jogueiNota 10/10 sem muito papo!;Recommended;703;74.4;03-28-2024

Product received for freeOverall, probably the most approachable souls game. 9/10, would be a perfect 10 if I didn't have random stutters, freezes or crashes. Multiplayer is also quite jank, but that's just FromSoftware games in a nutshell.You should fight Malenia.Praise, weak foe! Therefore, try rolling!;Recommended;261;188.1;03-28-2024

Way too hard for no dang reason. No direction in the game, you just wander around with no instruction and no guidance. The controls are weird for some things. I followed a guide to get souped up early and still couldn't fight a little boss without getting one shot but I have to hit him 1,000 times to kill him. It's just not even a little bit enjoyable. There should be difficulty settings, it would be a much more enjoyable game for people like me if I could choose an easy difficulty. Not everyone wants to pay $60 to slam their head against the wall for hours haha;Not Recommended;461;11.9;03-28-2024

"""Colossally big"" wouldn't even come close to describing this game's sheer scale. You won't need to buy another game for a while after this, there's so much to do and see it feels like 5 games stacked on top of one another. The less you know about this game the better, so if what I've said intrigues you just buy it. 4/5";Recommended;259;60.1;03-27-2024
