My 2nd best video game of all time, next to Bloodborne. I've completed all of FromSoftware's Soulsborne games, and I would say this is the culmination of all of those. I platinumed/100% completed this game in just 1 week on PlayStation 5 during its release week, and my run was in the top 0.6% completion overall at that time. I found a game boosting side job and earned a few bucks from it. It ruined every RPG that came out and that I played after it up to this day. What else can I say? That's how great it is!I wish I could put it as my best of all time, but Bloodborne holds a special place in my heart, so it won't happen anytime soon. I've spent hundreds of hours on PlayStation 5 and will still spend more on Steam PC, as I'm preparing a new character for the next DLC (Shadow of the Erdtree). The only downside to this game is that it will ruin your fun and experience with other RPGs that come out afterward. It's one of the greatest games ever made. You haven't played it yet? What are you playing other than this? Stop it. Don't sleep on it. Go grab it NOW!;Recommended;862;8.6;03-30-2024

Good Game;Recommended;8;113.7;03-30-2024
It's a good game it just has too much garbage to filter through. If you're experienced at these games you're also going to have to gimp yourself a lot to find any enjoyment out of it otherwise its going to be too easy. The modifier stacking in this game is insane, its practically Nioh levels of insanity where you can basically bypass the combat system with diablo power stacking through buffs, rings, consumables ect. The ashes of war are also far too powerful and are easily spammed without consequence. Most of your power is defined by them where neutral play matters far less.Most of the open world is forgettable and redundant only there to pad the game time and appeal to a different audience that enjoys that kind of experience. Liurnia of the Lakes is by far the worse example of this and its always a slog to go through even when you're skipping through 90% of it. The underground areas are also vapid derivative empty spaces of time wasting. The worst is Nokstella, a complete waste of time that you cant even use the horse to trudge through. Most of these areas only serve to plod along the plot of the most self indulgent unlikeable character in the game. It's all extremely disappointing.The pacing also suffers as well. Most of the game feels too samey in terms of enemy power level where the player starts to outscale them until you get to mountaintops of the giants and then the enemy power curve leaps exponentially. Caelid, Luiurina, Altus, Leyndell Capital all feel very similar in terms of enemy power. The bridge between them and Mountaintops is supposed to be Volcano Manor/Mt Gelmir but even that feels way undertuned compared to mountaintops. My issue with this is that it really feels like the game doesn't start until you get to mountaintops as the stuff you did beforehand feels irrelevant. Playing through NG+ cycles only makes the gap wider and its a real problem I have with this game.With all that being said this game is still worth it despite all of these problems. The boss design is solid and the movement options like crouching and jumping feel good and don't overly oppress the core dark souls combat. Legacy dungeons are by far the best this game offers, areas like Stormveil Castle, Farum Azula, Miquella's Haligtree, Leyndell Capital are very well designed and are worth trudging through the open world to get to.The core combat is still dark souls and the formula is very addicting where you can spend hours of fulfillment killing hordes of enemies. Although the game does prod you into abusing cheesy mechanics or diablo power stacking, you never have to and there is a level of satisfaction gained after achieving a certain level of mastery over the challenges the game puts you through. I think this is what keeps me hooked to this game above all else.;Recommended;2309;619.0;03-30-2024

Fun game and fantastic world. Exploration is definitely rewarded.Difficulty is on the high side but not horribly unfair.For those who don't want the challenge but would like to try the game mods are just a google search away and there are some that lower the difficulty or nearly eliminate it if you just want closer to tourist mode. If you go this route I do recommend trying the game later on with mods off once you have some experience with the mechanics.While some starting classes are more powerful out the gate than others I recommend going with whichever catches your fancy or fits what you believe to be your style. All starting classes ultimately become whatever you make them through gear and leveling.With the DLC around the corner it is a good time to get started. Though waiting for a deal once the DLC hits is also an option.Overall definitely recommend for any gamer who likes swords, sorcery, and exploration.;Recommended;766;768.4;03-30-2024
"Elden Ring? Oh, please. That so-called ""challenge"" was child's play for someone of my caliber. Every achievement in that game was practically handed to me on a silver platter. From conquering bosses with my eyes closed to navigating the open world with one hand tied behind my back, it was all too easy. I finished the game before most players even figured out how to swing a sword properly. Maybe next time they'll make a game worthy of my skills, but until then, I'll bask in the glory of effortlessly conquering Elden Ring.";Recommended;434;24.1;03-30-2024

The underground areas are also vapid derivative empty spaces of time wasting. The worst is Nokstella, a complete waste of time that you cant even use the horse to trudge through. Most of these areas only serve to plod along the plot of the most self indulgent unlikeable character in the game. It's all extremely disappointing.The pacing also suffers as well. Most of the game feels too samey in terms of enemy power level where the player starts to outscale them until you get to mountaintops of the giants and then the enemy power curve leaps exponentially. Caelid, Luiurina, Altus, Leyndell Capital all feel very similar in terms of enemy power. The bridge between them and Mountaintops is supposed to be Volcano Manor/Mt Gelmir but even that feels way undertuned compared to mountaintops. My issue with this is that it really feels like the game doesn't start until you get to mountaintops as the stuff you did beforehand feels irrelevant. Playing through NG+ cycles only makes the gap wider and its a real problem I have with this game.With all that being said this game is still worth it despite all of these problems. The boss design is solid and the movement options like crouching and jumping feel good and don't overly oppress the core dark souls combat. Legacy dungeons are by far the best this game offers, areas like Stormveil Castle, Farum Azula, Miquella's Haligtree, Leyndell Capital are very well designed and are worth trudging through the open world to get to.The core combat is still dark souls and the formula is very addicting where you can spend hours of fulfillment killing hordes of enemies. Although the game does prod you into abusing cheesy mechanics or diablo power stacking, you never have to and there is a level of satisfaction gained after achieving a certain level of mastery over the challenges the game puts you through. I think this is what keeps me hooked to this game above all else.;Recommended;2309;619.0;03-30-2024

Fun game and fantastic world. Exploration is definitely rewarded.Difficulty is on the high side but not horribly unfair.For those who don't want the challenge but would like to try the game mods are just a google search away and there are some that lower the difficulty or nearly eliminate it if you just want closer to tourist mode. If you go this route I do recommend trying the game later on with mods off once you have some experience with the mechanics.While some starting classes are more powerful out the gate than others I recommend going with whichever catches your fancy or fits what you believe to be your style. All starting classes ultimately become whatever you make them through gear and leveling.With the DLC around the corner it is a good time to get started. Though waiting for a deal once the DLC hits is also an option.Overall definitely recommend for any gamer who likes swords, sorcery, and exploration.;Recommended;766;768.4;03-30-2024
"Elden Ring? Oh, please. That so-called ""challenge"" was child's play for someone of my caliber. Every achievement in that game was practically handed to me on a silver platter. From conquering bosses with my eyes closed to navigating the open world with one hand tied behind my back, it was all too easy. I finished the game before most players even figured out how to swing a sword properly. Maybe next time they'll make a game worthy of my skills, but until then, I'll bask in the glory of effortlessly conquering Elden Ring.";Recommended;434;24.1;03-30-2024

Jaw-dropping experience.Not the best combat out there, you will die, and i mean, a lot. Elden Ring is so rewarding, so fulfilling.You will have to go back and forth multiple times, because you are probably under-level, but that's why this game is so unique and special. I never thought i would like souls-like games, but exploring this open-world is something i have never seen in any other videogame ever before. it is truly remarkable.Every location you explore is incredibly built and designed, with tons of secrets, hidden places and doors, multiple precious items, and incredible views to see.I truly think everyone should play this game, atleast once, in his life, it is simply incredible, something taken from fantasy books.Just have in mind that you're most of the times, the victim. You will have to farm EXP, kill a lot of mobs, get good gear and upgrade it, until you get stronger, in order to go into new areas of the map, search a lot online, you will probably need it, as zones have level caps, but this game wont tell you anything, literally, anything, but well... i guess that's the beauty of it.Be patient, do not rush enemies, study their moves and patterns first, then take your move and kill them, dodge or parry exactly in the last second, remember, this is Elden Ring, exploration is key, if you cant beat an enemy, do not worry, come back later.For 3 times i thought to myself, i m not ever playing this again, but i was wrong.TRY.

Elden Ring is truly beautiful. The game is worth the money and i absolutely recommend playing this game. I had 75+ hours on this game, while i had just started the game. In numbers i would rate this game 9.8/10. Just do more research before buying this type of games cuz it may be super hard for those players who get angry when they die. SO its definitely not for impatient Players.;Recommended;312;77.5;03-30-2024

Greatest game ever made. This not some procedurally generated world that many game studios have lately started to embrace this new AI hype bandwagon. This game is a carefully hand-crafted piece of art. But, I'll say this, YOU'LL ONLY GET TO EXPERIENCE THIS GREAT JOURNEY ONCE. So, take your time to thoroughly explore the world yourself first and then rely on online guides or walkthroughs, because the satisfaction of having to discover something is beyond putting it into words. Have fun and MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD.;Recommended;433;90.6;03-30-2024
This was my first souls-like game. After 90 minutes, I contemplated requesting a refund because the combat was too difficult and I did not understand where I was supposed to go. Now I am giving this game a thumbs up because I played 176 hours after contemplating a return.;Recommended;224;178.9;03-30-2024
This game is good fun. The fights can be challenging but they feel really good and it's great when you finally beat that tough boss. The scale and design of the world and it's characters is amazing. I thought the verticality of everything to be particularly stunning. It's nice to explore too, and there is usually at least something to reward you for exploring off the beaten path. Good variety in play-styles and enemies as well. Only critique is I wish quests were a little more clear.9/10;Recommended;406;103.5;03-30-2024

beautiful game not as hard as other souls game if you run blleed or magic builds but still a good game none the less;Recommended;93;52.0;03-30-2024
Overall this is a really fun game that I think people should try at least once. The combat both in and out of boss fights is engaging and rewarding and you get a true sense of accomplishment for every victory you take. The only thing that I wasn't too much of a fan of is how disjointed and awkward some of the npc quests are. Often times they change locations (sometimes as far as the opposite side of the map) without so much as a clue as to where they might be going, making it so that its very easy to miss, sequence break or outright ruin entire quest-lines. However, this gripe is minor compared to everything else I loved about the game. Overall I'd give this title a 9/10 and i'm very excited to see where the dlc takes the series next.;Recommended;602;102.9;03-30-2024

My introduction to fromsoft. I've never found myself so committed to a video game. I played hours on end and in fact I am still doing it after 150 hours because there is still so much left to cover in the game. If you are stuck on a boss (will happen a lot), you have the ability to leave and come back twice as strong as before. There are so many sidequests, questlines for different endings, weapons, spells, and so much content. If you love exploring and enjoying a good challenge, please play.;Recommended;405;169.4;03-30-2024

Amazing game, 10/10 and im not even finished yet.There are slight issues, First of all, knowing the next place you are supposed to go for the main story is quite difficult, most of my time is spent running around trying to figure out where im supposed to be. I guess this is intentional? its kind of fun to explore and find side quests.The main quests are sooo much fun tho, the main bosses in this game are truly incredible...The combat is so much fun really. but the most stand out thing about this game is the incredible game design visually (genius art styles). The atmosphere and legendary boss battles are sooooo stunning.This game punches so far beyond any game ive seen. Its in a whole class of its own really.I think im CPU limited on a ryzen 5600 at 4k so im probably not getting full 120 fps, but its worth it for better visuals.

It took me about 100 hours just to beat the game once. I haven't even fought all the bosses, completed all of the quests or collected every weapon and spell. I would 100% say this game is worth the 60 bucks just from the gameplay alone. 10/10 goty;Recommended;200;100.2;03-30-2024

It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.One of the greatest games ever released this generation, even for someone like me who typically don't play Souls-type games. The staggering amount of content, the sense of scale, and the world design/world-building, gives the player a sense of exploration unlike any other game. The art style, enemy variety, boss design are incredible, and the soundtracks are amazing.The combat is great, and the bosses are some of the hardest in the series (looking at you, Malenia), but you never feel frustrated, and instead try to get better. However, game balancing is an issue. You can kill a demigod with three moves, but die to a ghost on the other side of the map.The game is designed in a way that the player can make the game as difficult as he wants or as easy he wants, using the summons and tools given, making this game very accessible to any new players to Soulslike games.If you're wondering about the hype and whether it truly is a great game, let me tell you as a newcomer to Soulslikes in general, yes, this game is a must-play and I'm so glad I've experienced it. 9/10;Recommended;933;104.7;03-30-2024

"Elden Ring is one of my favorite games of all time. originally I was skeptical on weather I would enjoy Elden Ring or not simply because I had never played a souls game before and they have a certain reputation of being difficult games so I waited a year before I ended up saying to myself ""ehhh it looks cool and it's on sale so why not?"". However I ended up enjoying this game way more than I thought and for anyone who is skeptical because it's a souls game then I would suggest buying Elden Ring because 1: it is the easiest souls game because of the open world and 2nd: There are multiple difficulty sliders such as: Leveling Vigor, Using Magic, Using Summons, and Farming Souls. So with that said my favorite parts of Elden Ring are as follows: The rich, vast open world that feels amazing to explore, The insane amount of weapons, armor, and spells included to make it easy to create many cool builds, and the weird part for me is I never beat the game or even went to the Mountaintops of the Giants because for some reason I had so much fun doing Limgrave over and over again 40-70 times. 11/10.

I love this game. So much so that when I die because I got stuck on a rock, or because a random enemy didn't de-aggro and shot an arrow across the map with deadly precision, I blame myself for not being good enough.;Recommended;173;531.4;03-29-2024

I am a huge fan of souls games, but this game is different in its own ways. I really enjoyed the scenery in this game, it is very beautiful and very detailed. I usually don't like open world maps in games but I think the creators did really good when they made this game. I highly recommend this game.;Recommended;243;35.2;03-29-2024

Unbound open world prioritizing exploration but the devs can't design quests for ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, enemies are spammy {kindred of rot). Will end up needing a guide because they can't seem to write or hint at anything. Missing basic settings and controls on PC feel unpolished.;Recommended;221;128.0;03-29-2024

It's fantastic. Even for people unfamiliar with FromSoft's other games, this game is accessible in spite of its lineage of difficulty. There are multiple things you can do to gain strength, and also multiple strategies you can employ within combat itself.The addition of the open world and crafting system is a huge boon to the formula. The open world encourages exploration, which has always been a strong point in FromSoft games, and also opens up tons of opportunities to power up through side activities and explore quests through the various characters you can find and talk to. The crafting system also functions as a way to ease exploration by creating useful tools, as well as make combat more manageable through crafting throwables, ammo, status inflicting items and buffs.The moment to moment gameplay is vastly improved as well. You still have your light and heavy attacks, your guarding and parrying, and your magical spells in two different flavors. But all of these features have improved in a number of ways, including new ways to interact in combat. Combat Arts can be a fundamental part of the way you play, opening up lots of new moves and abilities, the new guard counter allows for a much more defensive playstyle to punish opponents after they attack, and heavy (especially charged heavy) attacks can break your opponents stance to open them up to critical hits. If you're struggling with a fight, changing your strategy can be a viable option, and if that fails then opening up the crafting menu can also give you the edge you need. If all else fails, you can rely on your fellow Tarnished and summon a friend (or stranger) to help you out in multiplayer.This game is the best version released of FromSoft's formula that they've been refining for years. As someone who's played every game in the Souls series, including Bloodborne and Sekiro, this one is my favorite. And here's to hoping the DLC improves on this already great game even more!;Recommended;1632;119.9;03-29-2024

I like that you have to pay attention to attacks of enemies and running headlong into a fight is not always the best way to defeat enemies. Also, the variation of styles of your character allows for replay ability with varying outcomes of quests. One real negative thing I have to say is dialogue and story is sometimes tedious.;Recommended;270;347.2;03-29-2024
"This game saved my career as a truck driver. On the night of February 20, 2022 I was called into my boss's office. Larry sat me down on the other side of his desk, at this moment I was quite ecstatic, I thought I was going to get a pay raise for how good I had been doing on the road! Oh boy was I wrong. Larry had told me that I was actually causing a loss of profits for the company and that if I didn't step up my performance soon they would have no choice but to get rid of me. I thought to myself ""‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! I can't lose my job, I'm 57 years old with 10 years of payments left on my mortgage, $15,000 in student loan debt, $50,000 in credit card debt, a wife, 3 kids, 4 dogs, and 2 cats. This might be the end for me."" I took the next day off of work to collect myself, and that's when I saw it. I opened up Steam for the first time in months, at the top there was a bright green banner with the beautiful, bold, yellowed letters ""ELDEN RING"" at the top. Now, as a big fan of the previous hit FromSoftware game ""Dark Souls 2"" I knew I had to check it out. I was hooked just from the images, don't even get me started about those videos. They put a little pep in my step if you're picking up what I'm putting down. I pre-ordered the game immediately, but I thought to myself ""How do I play this on the road?"" I knew there was only one option, so I did it. I ordered a Steam Deck to accompany me on my journeys travelling through the blessed lands of freedom. Before I knew it, the Steam Deck had arrived and Elden Ring had been released. I played this game every single night when I was parked in the truck stops. I was in love, for the first time in forever I felt like I enjoyed my job again. I was motivated to get my performance up and save my career. My performance increased by 76% when I started playing Elden Ring and my boss actually ended up giving me a raise. Thank you Miyazaki and FromSoftware for changing my life.";Recommended;1540;182.6;03-29-2024
"Remember a time when you're dad would come home after a long day at work?He would walk in all tired, have a shower maybe sit infront of the TV and watch a WWE, and both of you would have a blast watching Rey Mysterio 619 the Big Show. All was right in the world.But sometimes father, he'd have a few beers, and maybe he'd get a little mad at mum for cooking Meatloaf (Again) and you'd sit all quiet while he yells at her, and she hits him and then he looks at you, with that same look he just had for your mother. He grabs you by the arm and punches you in your 8 year old mouth. You sit there stunned, helpless because father always hits you when he and mother yell at each other.Years this goes on until one day you've had enough. You move out of home and go out into the world keen to never look back on these dark times again.

BEST GAME I PLAYED TBH;Recommended;18;260.9;03-29-2024
I like that you have to pay attention to attacks of enemies and running headlong into a fight is not always the best way to defeat enemies. Also, the variation of styles of your character allows for replay ability with varying outcomes of quests. One real negative thing I have to say is dialogue and story is sometimes tedious.;Recommended;270;347.2;03-29-2024
"This game saved my career as a truck driver. On the night of February 20, 2022 I was called into my boss's office. Larry sat me down on the other side of his desk, at this moment I was quite ecstatic, I thought I was going to get a pay raise for how good I had been doing on the road! Oh boy was I wrong. Larry had told me that I was actually causing a loss of profits for the company and that if I didn't step up my performance soon they would have no choice but to get rid of me. I thought to myself ""‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! I can't lose my job, I'm 57 years old with 10 years of payments left on my mortgage, $15,000 in student loan debt, $50,000 in credit card debt, a wife, 3 kids, 4 dogs, and 2 cats. This might be the end for me."" I took the next day off of work to collect myself, and that's when I saw it. I opened up Steam for the first time in months, at the top there was a bright green banner with the beautiful, bold, yellowed letters ""ELDEN RING"" at the top. Now, as a big fan of the previous hit FromSoftware game ""Dark Souls 2"" I knew I had to check it out. I was hooked just from the images, don't even get me started about those videos. They put a little pep in my step if you're picking up what I'm putting down. I pre-ordered the game immediately, but I thought to myself ""How do I play this on the road?"" I knew there was only one option, so I did it. I ordered a Steam Deck to accompany me on my journeys travelling through the blessed lands of freedom. Before I knew it, the Steam Deck had arrived and Elden Ring had been released. I played this game every single night when I was parked in the truck stops. I was in love, for the first time in forever I felt like I enjoyed my job again. I was motivated to get my performance up and save my career. My performance increased by 76% when I started playing Elden Ring and my boss actually ended up giving me a raise. Thank you Miyazaki and FromSoftware for changing my life.";Recommended;1540;182.6;03-29-2024
"Remember a time when you're dad would come home after a long day at work?He would walk in all tired, have a shower maybe sit infront of the TV and watch a WWE, and both of you would have a blast watching Rey Mysterio 619 the Big Show. All was right in the world.But sometimes father, he'd have a few beers, and maybe he'd get a little mad at mum for cooking Meatloaf (Again) and you'd sit all quiet while he yells at her, and she hits him and then he looks at you, with that same look he just had for your mother. He grabs you by the arm and punches you in your 8 year old mouth. You sit there stunned, helpless because father always hits you when he and mother yell at each other.Years this goes on until one day you've had enough. You move out of home and go out into the world keen to never look back on these dark times again. Not long after, you've started a family of your own, and you've vowed to never be like your father, you'd always treat your child better then he ever did.Until one day, a messages comes by, ""Hi son.

The Game is mediocre at best. While the story and the content are marvelous, the design, music and scenery is some to really behold. IT all falls apart in the gameplay mechanic.Early game you have to really grind to get somewhere and progress and rewarding is measured with a strict hand. You better stick 1 specific weapon and sink all the upgrades in it or the bosses will become even more grinding than they are at some point.Midgame the pace picks up and until you get to the endgame content, you can fare pretty good and the rewards upscale a lot. This is the part where most fun is to be had.Endgame content is typical, every enemy is overscaled, overpoised, overboosted in every way. In some cases some simple regular enemies have more hitpoints than some midgame bosses. Technically your HP is irrelevant as you are 1-3 hits, depending on your vitality. In some cases, some simpel field mobs are pvp worthy, the invader NPC-s have nothing compared to them. Even bosses can be hardly compared to some. Also, mediocre weapons are hidden in endgame which would be useful in earlier stages, grabbing them simply adds nothing to the gameplay.In many cases the best tactic to use: dash from 1 SG to another, you have your progress saved. Farming is done via boss assisting, item acquisition can be postponed. You won't use most of them anyway in bossfights.Also when a game has pixelperfect platforming integrated instantly looses 3 points in my eyes.All in all not a bad game but the endgame technically kills the part to which try to aim.Tho Malenia is cool.;Not Recommended;1290;287.5;03-29-2024

This game is a masterpiece, I don't like to glaze too much, but this game just deserves it. this game is huge and you will have lots to do, the enemies are challenging so you won't speed through the game too quickly, the story is very in depth and interesting, the game has lots of customisation so you can enjoy a build that works for you. The open world format for this game helps because if you are struggling with a boss, you can go somewhere else and get stronger, now the boss will be less difficult. only thing i don't like is the multiplayer, it kind of sucks, but there are mods that fix that. 10/10;Recommended;492;101.2;03-29-2024

This game is a masterpiece, I don't like to glaze too much, but this game just deserves it. this game is huge and you will have lots to do, the enemies are challenging so you won't speed through the game too quickly, the story is very in depth and interesting, the game has lots of customisation so you can enjoy a build that works for you. The open world format for this game helps because if you are struggling with a boss, you can go somewhere else and get stronger, now the boss will be less difficult. only thing i don't like is the multiplayer, it kind of sucks, but there are mods that fix that. 10/10;Recommended;492;101.2;03-29-2024

Do you enjoy dying over and over again? Hopefully the answer is yes, because it will happen in this game. Ride a magical horse finding magical weapons all the time and fight and kill enemies. It is a fun souls game.;Recommended;175;138.8;03-29-2024

Put 130 hours in and didn't even beat it.This game offers so much in terms of world, items, bosses, side-content, interconnected story-lines, etc, that even players seasoned to this type of game can still get bogged down.That being said, I had to come back to prepare for the DLC in June.ELDEN RING's take on an open-world was very well-executed, dense with points of interest, and varied in terms of environment and enemy type. Even though not perfect when compared to other FROMSOFT games, mainly in its tendency to reuse bosses somewhat heavy-handedly, the sense of exploration and achievement you can get from this title is amazing9/10[Waiting to see how DLC affects game at large];Recommended;572;146.9;03-29-2024

"Elden Ring was my first souls game and I have to say I was not disappointed at all. The style of gameplay was new to me because I've known nothing besides first person shooter games; nonetheless I was able to adjust fast. If you're looking for something new, fun, rewarding, and intense I suggest this game highly. Not only is the game amazing in terms of graphics, but it prevails in other areas where developers seem to be struggling right now as of 2024. For instance: Story/lore, gameplay mechanics, level design, voice acting, in-game rewards, no micro transactions, helpful/funny/dedicated community, graphics again, creativity, etc. I can go on and on about how great Elden Ring is but this is actually that one game where you must play it for yourself to find out. If you get stuck there's plenty of guides and videos online to help you. This is one investment you will not regret. Have fun Tarnished!";Recommended;752;168.4;03-29-2024

I get it, another Elden Ring review that is negative that is unfounded but just giving my feedback.The mandatory, I have played Demon Souls, all of the Dark Souls games, Sekiro Armored Core 6 (I know its not Souls but its awesome!).I like the tighter experience of previous titles, smaller, interconnected, filled with purpose.I felt Elden Ring was just a big world with dumb mobs placed every where, dungeons that felt so samey, reskinned bosses, and just crap tons of stuff to get into. For me it was a grind to just get through it.I guess I have gotten older and want to play whats fun not whats trendy, it just wasnt for me. I am not a combat efficientato by any means and the options, spells, ashes of war, summons were all good systems. At its core though, for ME, its just tiresome. Why or how can poison go through a wall? Why can a bad guy plunge his axe through rock and hit you on the other side? Why do bosses have unlimited stamina? Elden Ring had some of the most aggressive boss battles I have ever played through in a From Software game. Hands down. The last section of the game is littered with them back to back to back, its insane. Granted the open world gives opportunities to gain some flasks back but thats so you dont have to go back to a spot to heal again, it didnt make it more accepting in terms of difficulty. The dungeons generally are filled with the same wolves, pots, and gremlins, with a few traps and a boss or two at the end of it. Once you get the goodies in the dungeon or cave you usually find yourself dead at the bosses door or near death with no flasks forcing you to death with the boss so that you can just run all the way to the door again if there was no stake to bring you back to near the door. Fighting on the horse was fun although, the farther you get into the game, the more you realize the horse is just another piece of armor that most enemies are going to be able to kill. Its fast but they are faster.I think for people who love this genre and the Souls franchise this is a dream come true. Its a big expansive world with enough variety for people who want to see it, and lots of things to explore. More mini bosses, more dungeons, more exploration, more armor/weapons, summons, just more more more. But its also just more frustration, cheap boss battles and the ever present git gud mantra of some really just becomes icing on the cake, yeah, I dont need to do this anymore.;Not Recommended;1969;84.6;03-29-2024
I love how creative you can get with all the different kinds of builds, makes for tons of replayability. Don't be afraid to run passed enemies or come back to fight a boss later. You'll likely need a guide for NPC storylines though, no shame in that. Music is peak.;Recommended;216;604.9;03-29-2024
Well, what can I say - This game is Masterpiece, 10 out of 10.It took 300 hours for me to beat the game, with all side quests and exploring every corner of the map.And guess what - I was never bored playing Elden Ring!Waiting for DLC with great impatience;Recommended;207;310.4;03-29-2024

Probably the most fun I ever had in a video game. Exploration feels really fun and rewarding. Not just for the loot but the sight you get is a reward in itself. Combat is typical souls combat but with new skills and spells. The danger you feel while exploring the world really makes you feel like you are on a adventure which a game very rarely manages to get right in my opinion.The things I dislike are rather minor like the copy pasted catacombs with copy/pasted enemies and interior. You may also get to other low level zones later which means you'll completely obliterate a boss, that could be fun to learn. The biggest problem I have with this game is the reuse of enemies and bosses. There are MANY unique enemies and bosses but some bosses appear like 6 times which takes some of the excitement away. Especially when a big story boss reappears as a random optional boss with a misspelled name.;Recommended;738;279.7;03-29-2024

Wow amazing game a little late to the party becasue I just got a pc this holiday but this game is great, im only like 22 hours in and like 2 main bosses down and im still loving every second of this game! Im sure you all heard it by now but this game is a must buy 10/10 for me.;Recommended;218;25.3;03-28-2024
This game is incredible. Have played it from start to finish at least a dozen times now, including (1) play-through that is at NG+6. It's difficult, and certainly has a learning curve, being my first souls-type game, but it was probably the most rewarding game to complete I've ever played. Gladly will be paying for the DLC to extend this gameplay.One warning, is that once you learn the combat system of this game, it will make all others feel stale, boring, or easy in comparison. That is the only down-side I had found, and I'm not entirely sure it's a bad thing to have high standards for gaming studios moving forward.;Recommended;514;290.9;03-28-2024

Obviously nothing really needs to be said about this game what with it being so critically acclaimed and all. I loved it! The stealth mechanic that migrated over from Sekiro is a welcome addition. So many of the environments felt like call backs to previous soulsbourne games which I loved to see. There are so many different play styles available for someone since their are so many different weapons and spells. 10/10- would forget my entire playthrough and enjoy again!;Recommended;393;127.7;03-28-2024

Very rarely do I wish that a game never ended, but this one felt like a magnificent dream that looked to have no end in sight. When it finally did it was a bitter sweet moment. Every area is so detailed, so beautiful, so rich in character and atmosphere that its almost unreal. The combat is fluid, weapons/spells are all interesting and feel fresh whenever you use something new, build diversity is there. The enemies offer challenge level from easy to hard to b.s but that's all part of this mountain that you must climb, b.s and all. Some of the best designed bosses in all souls games including sekiro. Jumping is a simple yet refreshing game mechanic that makes the game play feel more free. The MUSIC needs to praise because it goes without saying. 10/10;Recommended;624;144.9;03-28-2024

Elden Ring made me stop playing halfway because towards the late game it was getting a little too brutal, BUT WE DONT BACK DOWN AND WE NEVER GIVE UP AND WE BEAT IT 2 MORE TIMES BECAUSE THIS IS GOTY. I always say the souls games get better the more you replay them. So if you read this, get a new character and your dragon smithing stones ready the the shadow of the erdtree.I be Mohging all the way to the erdtree, first play through was a grim reaper black flame scythe build (made for a strength play-style but with a focus on dexterity). The frenzied flame incantations are the best edition to the souls magic system and was the core of my NG+ play through. Lazers shooting out your eyes and morgotts cursed sword were stat hungry tools but lvl 155 allowed for a hybrid build that leaves scorched earth in a wake. The 3rd play through I finally got around to using my favorite archetype of weapon, the colossal swords. Worked in most of them to deal with different areas and bosses but the real hero was actually working the grafted dragon first to the off hand to roll catch and get safe hits on bosses. The mimic tear spirit ashes is for noobs. So I used the Jellyfish and the stormhawk. Intelligence and the way of fists are gonna be the next play through.;Recommended;1026;256.0;03-28-2024

I'm writing this review out of gratitude to FromSoftware and a person called D.Dark Souls type games where never my thing, I never hated them. I just felt them to be too difficult and didn't seethe reward in them.Elden ring was exposure therapy for me, suggested to me by D.I had severe trauma related to failing from my childhood, so I had my doubts about how this would help.However with help from D, the repeated failings/deaths turned into courage to take on bigger bosses.Now after months of hard work I have all the achievements in a game I never thought I would ever playand i'm starting to take on bigger challenges in my life. I'm no longer crippled by my past as long as I am challenging myself.So thank you to D and to FromSoftwareI'm greatfull;Recommended;620;140.0;03-28-2024

Fantastic entry by Fromsoft, I've never been let down so far and Elden Ring is truly a modern classic. I liked it so much I even bought a copy for my PC for the DLC in July. It can be extremely difficult but they have many ways to make a boss fight or situation easier.

Uma obra primaO jogo n√£o levou o goty atoa, um mundo aberto extremamente vivo, com muitos objetivos para fazer itens para encontra, uma variedade enorme de armas e build para variar a gameplay, o combate do jogo √© maravilhoso, e n√£o tenho nem oque comentar sobre como a Lore desse jogo √© incr√≠vel e como todas as bossfight s√£o boas e √∫nicas, com efeitos sonoros e uma trilha sonora de bater Palmas de p√©, a batalha contra rykard e radaan s√£o um √≥timo exemplo disso, um jogo que dificilmente cair√° no esquecimento. E de todos os jogos que j√° joguei com certeza esse √© o com o melhor fator replay de todos, voc√™ quer muito jogar de novo e de novo.

Way too hard for no dang reason. No direction in the game, you just wander around with no instruction and no guidance. The controls are weird for some things. I followed a guide to get souped up early and still couldn't fight a little boss without getting one shot but I have to hit him 1,000 times to kill him. It's just not even a little bit enjoyable. There should be difficulty settings, it would be a much more enjoyable game for people like me if I could choose an easy difficulty. Not everyone wants to pay $60 to slam their head against the wall for hours haha;Not Recommended;461;11.9;03-28-2024

This game is a masterpiece. I know this review is incredibly late and we all know it won GotY, but seriously, I love this game with all my heart. The lore, gameplay, and design all come together to make a game that I seriously have to recommend. I truly could spend hours talking about this game but I'll try to keep it within reason (Though it'll still be a bit).Is this game for everyone? No. Combat is very punishing and balance can be a bit off for some boss fights. Sometimes fights leave you feeling like you were fighting the game itself rather than a boss, which can be very discouraging.But if you think you can get past that, this game is a wonderful project that can make you feel like a god when you finally overcome the obstacles in your way. The story feels impactful the more you begin to piece it together and you should never find yourself feeling as if the world is empty, exploration is almost always rewarded, and even if not by items or story, it's by the messages left by other players. And as mentioned before, combat is so incredibly satisfying when overcome. All weapons feel fun and unique to handle and the variety of builds you can play with is amazing, and when you gain access to respecing, the opportunities for changing your strategies with bosses is second to none.I truly could keep talking about this game, its impact on me as a person and truly just how fun it is to pick up and play. But I'll leave that for another platform. But take it from me, as I've spent 190 hours finding as many facets of this game as possible, please at least give it a go. It's so wonderful and I think anyone can find the enjoyment in it.Also the DLC is right around the corner so no better time to play this game and prepare to take on the challenges in the Shadow of the Erdtree!;Recommended;1460;194.1;03-27-2024

"Elden Ring has the worst combat system out of all of Myazaki's games. Most of the bosses are impossible to kill if you are by yourself or are not over-leveled for that encounter. The golden knights are impossible to fight on your own, especially the draconic variants, the main bosses are almost all horrible and frustrating to fight against unless you are some kind of demi-god or have memorized all the moves they do. The bosses have inhuman reactions, constantly spam 15 move combos, and spam a variety of distance attacks if you stay away from them. If you try to fight a draconic golden knight by yourself, you will be there for weeks if you want to do it all on your own with no summons and also without grinding and finding moonveil katanas. It would have been great if the combat was like Sekiro but better and the bosses were not so insane. It doesn't feel like a fight, it feels like you when you were a kid and you were defending yourself against daddy with the belt. Having to dodge 99% of the attacks and wait for a small opening to hit once and run away is not fun or intense, I learned nothing. Its just one big slog, one big mess where you push through everything in the most tiring and nerve-wracking way possible, in the end you have to resort to summoning bots in the fight. But you quickly find out the bots suck, so you go even further, just summoning other players to fight for you as you stay away mostly and hope that you are not the only one left in the end. And if you are, then you have very little chance because the end phases of the bosses will destroy you without you even getting near them, whether it is in the form of a fireball ·õãhitspam, or lighting strikes which you cant even dodge because they track your character's rolls. If you didn't have Estus to chuck every five seconds, you would be ·ö†ucked, in that case might as well summon a whole army of players, just make the game an open MMO.By the way, most fights in this game are useless because the enemies just respawn after you kill them, whats the point of fighting them if not for drops or runes or whatever. You never have the satisfaction of clearing out an area of enemies, you just have to run past them over and over. The open world is empty, vast majority of items you pick up will be some sort of materials or some useless junk, you kill a massive knight in armor and you pick up a ·ö†ucking crusty mushroom off his body... You go off exploring an area you think contains something cool, only to find its empty or has a corpse/chest which has a ""sliver of meat"" on it. At the early game you are basically depressed because you can't find sensible equipment to use, you are forced to open the wiki online to manually look up where the hell the damn armor is located. Same thing with the quests, you have no idea which character goes where and what the quests are, you can even miss quests just by playing the game, so you have to look at the wiki. Not only is the armor hard to find, most of it is hideous, the designes are just fantasy garbage, more than half of it doesn't even make sense nor does it look good. Only a handful of the plate armors look somewhat historically inspired, the banished knight's armor looks the coolest but still has issues like the horn on the shoulder and the fuzzy hair on the back.I give this a 5/10";Not Recommended;2701;101.0;03-27-2024

I pre-ordered the $100 Elden Ring bundle on Steam before it was released early in 2022 and remember that in the Steam store description it said that for pre-ordering the $100 edition. That I would get the digital artbook and soundtrack, a emote for use in-game as well as an expansion pass for future content. I assumed that the extra $40 when compared to the cheaper $60 edition of the Elden Ring pre-order available in the Steam store was for the mentioned future content. I have spent plenty on FromSoftware's amazing games and I am eager to play the new Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. However, I think that my extra $40 has gone to nothing when they decided to change how they planed on releasing new content for the game. I hope that isn't the case but would not be surprised if I don't get access to the dlc without forking over another $40 :( like wtf, in this economy LOL.;Recommended;730;439.2;03-26-2024

So nice, I bought it twice! If you like Souls-like games, you'll like Elden Ring. There are additional features like spirit ashes that can make this game significantly easier than previous fromsoft titles, but they're optional so it allows for a good amount of difficulty scaling without having an actual option to change it.If it's your first souls game, it will humble you. This game is tough but it's also very rewarding.;Recommended;353;143.6;03-26-2024
"I DON'T RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO NEVER PLAYED ANY DARK SOULS (Styled) GAMES -EVER-!(((I MUST NOTE BEFORE HAND: I am not dogging on the community or the game, it is a great game but it just too many flaws for a ""normal games"" Player and a huge waste of money. So don't take my post with hatred as i don't hate the game, just simply don't like it. )))I was bored with every game I had. and I wanted to try something completely new. So I asked around probably 20~ people about a game that would last me hours, maybe even days to enjoy and about 60%~ recommended Elden ring. I told them ""I've never played any Souls game in my life"" and they all said ""It doesn't matter since this is nothing like a Souls game"" so I took their word for it as they also told me ""it fun"" ""challenging"" and ""has a lot to offer"", and ill state that they weren't wrong. but it isn't ""Fun"", it's more than ""Challenging"" and there is no damn story. I have given it 5 hours of playtime just to see if I can give it a chance and after 5 hours, I was just so damn bored. It's a time waste. and I would love for a refund back so I can use my money for a fun game...CONS:- Boring- Tedious- Time Wasting- More than ""Challenging"" (if anything, EXTREMELY DIFFICULT)- Can't stay alive for more than 10 Minutes- Weak Weapons- Too many LVL Ups needed to use a different weapon- It's just Overall Boring and a time waste due to no Plot or Path to followPROS:- Extremely Difficult- Time Waster for those who have enough time to waste- uhhhhhh....

Elden Ring: A Masterpiece of Modern Art in Video GamesAs a long-time fan of video games, I've experienced many adventures, but few have captivated me as deeply as Elden Ring. From the moment I started playing, I was drawn into the epic world that FromSoftware has crafted with this game.The music of Elden Ring is nothing short of breathtaking. Every note, every chord contributes to amplifying the emotional depth of the game world. The compositions seamlessly adapt to the mood of the scenery, enhancing the gaming experience in a way that few games achieve.The voice actors also do an outstanding job, breathing life into the characters and infusing their stories with authenticity and depth. Each voice adds to the atmosphere of the game, making it an immersive experience.The atmosphere of Elden Ring is simply unparalleled. The dark yet captivating world is full of secrets and dangers. You can practically feel the story lurking in the abandoned ruins and majestic landscapes.The character design is another highlight of the game. Every NPC, every enemy, and every boss is meticulously crafted with attention to detail. Their designs are not only visually impressive but also contribute to the storytelling of the world.The various regions of Elden Ring are so diverse and well-designed that you never get bored exploring them. From gloomy swamps to majestic mountains, the game offers a wealth of landscapes to discover.And of course, the story cannot go unmentioned. Elden Ring tells a profound and captivating tale full of intrigue, betrayal, and heroic deeds. Every detail of the world contributes to unfolding the story, and it's a true pleasure to uncover each mystery.Overall, Elden Ring is undoubtedly a masterpiece of the modern art form of video games. From the music to the voice acting to the character design and the regions, everything is perfectly balanced, creating a gaming experience that will not be forgotten anytime soon. This game is an absolute must-play for any video game enthusiast.;Recommended;1691;100.1;03-26-2024

I'm going to be honest I have enjoyed fromsoft's games since the release of dark souls, I remember being a young kid hyped up and ready for a grueling sadomasochistic enjoyment of a never onslaught of death.With Elden Ring I've been disappointed.. the Bossfights and gameplay of half the game are copy pasted repeats of the content you first encounter in the game. With the speed and pace of boss battles being a frenzy of 5-7 hit combos, frequent unnatural delays meant to trip up a player, combine this with the half second input lag that frequently occurs on rolls, it's a recipe for disaster.This game took away from the experience of intuition that most souls games forced you to adapt yourself to, and instead require rote memorization of a boss' 20-30 possible moves and attacks to carefully dodge often requiring you to die a multitude times more than predecessors of the genre.Fights and combat are either overly difficult and needlessly long due to the abundance of flying and hyper-mobile enemies the size of 4 school busses, often needing to wait a full minute before you can get a single hit in. Or in the case of the elden beast, the final boss of the game running 10 football fields away requiring you to make a beeline 10-20 good times becoming an exhausting boring marathon of wacking a pinata with a stick on a treadmill. The late-game was a slew of lazy boss design and attack motions such as in the case of godfrey spamming a ground pound with the same animation 100 times in a row.The dungeons of the game are a boring slog, copy pasted over and over again with the same layout and bricks that put Skyrim to shame, filled with the same enemies you've fought the past half dozen times.While this is a good game, it's not the 10/10 GOTY everyone calls it, I'd dare anyone to venture beyond using mimic tear, spells, and rivers of blood to attempt a fight with a shortsword or club. Melee feels like crippling your knees with a bat before a 5k, whereas ranged builds are given an immense advantage that had not existed in prior iterations of the souls series.In essence I feel Fromsoft balanced their game around a multiplayer and coop experience which is even harder to find due to the endless amounts of cheats and mods, throughout the last 70 hours of playing I was never able to invade, find an invader, or even play a single match in the coliseum. Which makes me suspicious regarding the supposedly high player counts boasted of on steam.The art style is excellent, the lore and various questlines are intriguing, but the gameplay of the game bounces back and forth from being either far too easy, or punishing the player for using anything slower than a katana in melee combat, and at times making it NIGH impossible to score hits on certain enemies such as the fallingstar beast.I've never once wanted to speedrun a Dark Souls game, and with Elden Ring it couldn't be finished fast enough.;Not Recommended;2399;77.2;03-26-2024

The story line, lore, artistic direction, mechanics are just INSANELY beautiful and amazing, it s a pure jewel .Morrowind + Outward + Elden Ring are the Holy Trinity !!!!";Recommended;388;410.9;03-26-2024
